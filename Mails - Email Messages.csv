                 The Augmented Analytics Reset In Retail

Retail has undergone a tremendous amount of turmoil in recent years. The
Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered the way consumers shop, with
current global supply chain issues only adding to the chaos. Online
retail has experienced a huge surge which has led to challenges around
coping with scaling to meet customer demand and issues such as needing to
process a vastly increased number of returns.

As they have become accustomed to doing, retailers have looked to
analytics to help understand the changes they are facing. But the lack of
relevant data due to the unprecedented circumstances means insights have
not always been easy to find. Traditional retail analytics involves
examining past behavior in order to infer future behavior ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but existing
algorithms simply canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t account for disruption and accelerated change at
the scale weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve experienced.

View media in original article

To explore this topic in more detail, I spoke to Rich Clayton, vice
president for product strategy at Oracle Analytics, about the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½augmented
analytics resetï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s underway across the retail industry. This means a
fundamental rethink of what retailers can achieve with analytics and,
crucially, how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to expand its
scope throughout all business processes at all levels.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½In plain English, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s about putting advanced technology like AI and
machine learning ""From how we connect to data to how we combine it with other data
sources, to how we consume and share it so that we can all do our jobs
better.""

One principle of this ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½resetï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is that store operators can no longer
afford to be waiting for insights derived from a""trickle-down"" from centrally-located business intelligence or analytics
units. While we know thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a global shortage of data scientists, at the
same time, there has been an explosion in the availability of
applications, tools, and platforms that have the potential to put data in
the hands of everyone. This is where retailers should be looking for
strategies that will let them anticipate change and adapt accordingly.

Automated insights

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As an example ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a store manager, when they arrive at the store ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ their
cell phone can wake up and know theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re at the store. From there, it can
tell them what are the first three things they need to focus on right
away.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

This could mean alerts that inventory issues are predicted, or that data
suggests a particular product is going to be popular that day. The
manager can then go about their day-to-day activities, such as inventory
management, merchandising, display coordination, or interacting with
supply chain partners, based on the insiglytic reset starts by reflecting on current processes,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Clayton
says. This means examining the data platforms that are currently used
through the lens of the changed business priorities.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Once we reflect on our current state, we then begin to think about
restoring order and focus on our plans in the short term. What insights,
predictions, or analytic experiences do we need to focus on to meet the
new normal?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Only when thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s fully understood should we start to think about how
these changes might affect our long-term strategy, Clayton suggests.

Sustainable and connected experiences

Navigating this reset should involve creating strategies to tackle three
challenges ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ creating connected customer experiences, improving the
integrity and efficiency of supply chains, and using data to buil""Connected customer experience is probably the number one challenge today
because of how buying behavior is changing between online and offline,""
he tells me.

In fact, this aligns closely with the need to create sustainable profit
models, which, if they are managed properly, will emerge from the
connected experience. For example, retailers can look to correlate
customer activity across online and offline channels to build a more
complete picture of their behavior. Products and services can then be
offered with the aim of building and maintaining customer loyalty while
also generating profit.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Those are two things that are sometimes seen as being at odds with each
other, and I think that deeper insights through AI can help overcome some
of those challenges.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Managing returns in e-commerce is a great example of an area where new
thinking could have a dramatic impact. The dramatic upscaling in the
amount of online shopping being done by consumers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ up to 10 years of
growth in 18 months, by some estimates ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ means retailers are dealing with
far larger quantities of returned goods, generating waste and expense.

Artificiald to predict where these returns are
most likely to occur ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ what items will most frequently be returned, by
which customers, in what regions. It can also help identify when returns
are potentially fraudulent.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½If youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re just going to accept everything thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s returned, you're
proba"" says Clayton. ""But AI can predict which
items are most likely to be returned and make recommendations about what
can be done with some of those volatile items.""

Another area where analytics has been used to predict the effect of
dramatic societal changes has been anticipating where staff shortages
might be caused by older retail workers deciding to take early retirement
rather than return to the shop floor post-covid.

To get to the point where AI can help with decisions like these, many
retail organizations are going to need to overcome problems caused by
siloed data ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ data thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s been collected and stored for a specific
purpose but not made available to the wider business, for use in
innovative ways. All this can be achieved by taking the holistic approach
to data strategy ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ where the value of data is considered across all
business functions ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ that Clayton is ad""reset.""

New ways of disseminating the insights gleaned from data need to be
developed too, and here natural language processing (NPL) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ an Ai
technology that enables machines to express insights in natural, human
language, could be extremely valuable.

Store managers can't be expected to be data scientists ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ show them charts
and dashboards, and the insights might not be immediately obvious to
them. But the technology exists that can take data ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ whether it's sales
data, customer feedback data, or even social media chatter ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and use it
to create narratives that can be communicated verbally ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ like a bespoke
podcast tailored specifically for the person itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s intended for. This
would make situations like the one mentioned at the start of this article
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ where the store manager is automatically informed what their priorities
should be when they arrive at work in the morning ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a real possibility.

Speed, scope, and scale are the keywords that retail data stratemplementing these types of
changes or ""resets.""

There needs to be the capability to trial and launch data initiatives
quickly to keep up with the fast-paced change because insights that seem
critical today might not be relevant to the situation tomorrow. Scope
means always thinking about new data sources that can be included and new
channels that insights can be applied through. Scope means making sure
every aspect of operations and business processes is influenced by the
output of AI-augmented analytics.

Retailers have found themselves at the vanguard of an expedition into new
territory ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ simply because there is no rule book for managing the
widespread change in customer behavior that we see today. Those that are
willing to invest in innovation and the rollout of holistic, AI-driven
analytics strategies are best placed to achieve continued growth in these
fast-changing times.

God is actively at work through YouVersionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and hundreds of millions of people
are a part of it.
Every time someone installs YouVersion, theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re getting instant access to a
Community centered around the Bible. A Community thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s inviting God to shape
their lives through Scripture, Bible Plans, and Prayer.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Once I found [YouVersion], studied, read Plans, and connected with others, I
was hooked on the power of God flowing through the YouVersion Community.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

what God has done, weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re looking forward to what Heï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll do next.
Imagine a day in the near future when 1 billion people have installed
YouVersion.
You can help make this happen.
The best way to help us celebrate this historic moment is by sharing YouVersion
with someone in your life who hasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t been transformed by Godï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Word yet.
There are millions of people still waiting to be transformed by the Bible, and
you are perfectly positioned to reach some of them. Allow God to actively work
through you by inviting others to discover that The Bible is Alive.

                  The 8 Biggest Business Trends In 2022

Across all sectors, organizations are grappling with rapid
transformation. On top of that, there are enormous global shifts and
challenges to contend with, such as climate change, and shifting
political and economic power. To put it bluntly, our world is changing
fast. And organizations must learn to adapt accordingly.

These eight major trends provide a snapshot of how business operations
are evolving to suit our rapidly changing world.

View media in original article

Trend 1: Sustainable, resilient operations

Every organization must seek to eliminate or reduce the environmental
costs of doing business. Decarbonizing the supply chain is a sensible
place to start, but forward-thinking businesses are looking beyond the
supply chain to improve sustainability across all business operations.
And of course, sustainability is linked to resilience, since resilience
means being able to adapt and survive for the long term. Any business
that ignores sustainability is unlikely to do well in this age of
conscious consumption.

Trend 2: The balance between human workers and intelligent robots

We now have increasingly capable robots and artificial intelligence (AI)
systems that can take on tasks that were previously done by humans. This
leaves employers with some key questions: how do we find the balance
between intelligent machines and human intelligence? What roles should be
given over to machines? Which roles are best suited to humans? Thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s no
doubt that automation will affect every industry, so business leaders
must prepare their organizations ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and their people ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ for the changing
nature of work.

Trend 3: The shifting talent pool and changing e

The way we work is evolving, with more younger people entering the
workforce, more gig workers, and more remote workers. In their book The
Human Cloud, Matthew Mottola and Matthew Coatney argue that traditional
full-time employment will be a thing of the past, as organizations shift
to hiring people on a contract basis ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ with those contractors working
remotely.

Trend 4: Flatter, more agile organizations

Traditionally, organizations have been very hierarchical and rigid in
their structures. But that is changing, as leaders recognize the need for
flatter, more agile structures that allow the business to quickly
reorganize teams and respond to change. It is also, in part, a response
to the changing nature of work, particularly the proliferation of
freelance and remote workers.

This is the age of flatter organizational structures, which are more like
flexible communities rather than a top-down pyramid structure.

Trend 5: Authenticity

Todayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s consumers are seeking a more meaningful connectios.
And this need for connection has given rise to authenticity as a business
trend in its own right. Authenticity helps to foster human connections ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
because, as humans, we like to see brands (and business leaders) display
important human qualities like honesty, reliability, empathy, compassion,
humility, and maybe even a bit of vulnerability and fear. We want brands
(and leaders) to care about issues and stand for more than just turning a
profit.

Trend 6: Purposeful business

Linked to authenticity, this trend is all about ensuring your
organization exists to serve a meaningful purpose ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and not just serve up
profits to shareholders. Purpose defines why the organization exists.
(Not what the organization is or what it does or for whom. Therefore,
purpose is different to mission and vision.) Importantly, a strong
purpose has the promise of transformation or striving for something
better ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ be it a better world, a better way to do something, or whatever
is important to your organizationtition and integration

We live in a time where pretty much anything can be achieved by
outsourcing. The global business world has never been so integrated. And
itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a good job, because the need to work together to solve key business
challenges (not to mention humanityï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s biggest challenges) is great.
Indeed, in the future, it will become increasingly difficult to succeed
without really close partnerships with other organizations. In practice,
this means greater supply chain integration, more data integration and
sharing of data between organizations, and even cooperation between

Trend 8: New forms of funding

The ways in which companies can generate finance is also changing. New
platforms and mechanisms have sprung up to connect businesses with
investors and donors ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ think crowdfunding, initial coin offerings (ICOs),
tokenization and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Many of
these new methods are driven by the decentralized finance movement, in
which financiarrowing and trading take place in a
peer-to-peer network, via a public decentralized blockchain network.

In addition to these eight trends, there will also be transformative
technology trends in 2022 including artificial intelligence and
increasing digitization, which every company must be ready for. Read more
about all these and other future trends in my new book, Business Trends
in Practice: The 25+ Trends That are Redefining Organizations. Packed
with real-world examples, it cuts through the hype to present the key
trends that will shape the businesses of the future.

                My report from the climate change summit

Last week I spent three fantastic days at the global climate summit
(known as COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland. My main impression is how much
things have changed since the last summit, back in 2015ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t mean
because of COVID. The climate conversation has shifted dramatically, and
for the better.

View media in original article

One big shift is that clean-energy innovation is higher on the agenda
than ever. The world needs to get to zero carbon emissions by 2050. As I
argue in the book I published this year, accomplishing that will require
a green Industrial Revolution in which we decarbonize virtually the
entire physical economy: how we make things, generate elove
around, grow food, and cool and heat buildings. The world already has
some of the tools weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll need to do that, but we need a huge number of new
inventions too.

So at an event like this, one way I measure progress is by the way people
are thinking about what itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll take to reach zero emissions. Do they think
we already have all the tools we need to get there? Or is there a nuanced
view of the complexity of this problem, and the need for new, affordable
clean technology that helps people in low- and middle-income countries
raise their standard of living without making climate change worse?

Six years ago, there were more people on the we-have-what-we-need side
than on the innovation side. This year, though, innovation was literally
on center stage. One session of the World Leaders Summit, where I got
to speak, was exclusively about developing and deploying clean
technologies faster.

I also helped launch the Net Zero World Initiative, a commitment from the
U.S. government to help other countzero by providing funding
andï¿½ï¿½ï¿½even more importantï¿½ï¿½ï¿½access to experts throughout the government,
including the top minds at Americaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s world-class national laboratories.
These countries will get support with planning the transition to a green
economy, piloting new technologies, working with investors, and more.

The second major shift is that the private sector is now playing a
central role alongside governments and nonprofits. In Glasgow, I met with
leaders in various industries that need to be part of the
transitionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½including shipping, mining, and financial servicesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½who had
practical plans to decarbonize and to support innovation. I saw CEOs of
international banks really engaging with these issues, whereas many of
them wouldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t even have shown up a few years ago. (It made me wish we
could get the same kind of turnout and excitement for conferences on
global health!)

I announced that three new partnersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Citi, the IKEA Foundation, and State
Farmï¿½ï¿½ï¿½wila program
designed to get the most promising climate technologies to scale much
faster than would happen naturally. Theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re joining the first round of
seven partners we announced in September. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s amazing to see how much
momentum Catalyst has generated in just a few months.

I was also honored to join President Biden and his climate envoy, John
Kerry, to announce that Breakthrough Energy will be the primary
implementation partner for the First Movers Coalition. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a new
initiative from the U.S. State Department and the World Economic Forum
that will boost demand for emerging climate solutions in some of the
sectors where itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll be especially hard to eliminate emissions: aviation,
concrete and steel production, shipping, and more.

The third shift Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m seeing is that thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s even more visibility for
climate adaptation. The worst tragedy of rising temperatures is that they
will do the most harm to the people who have done the least to cause
them. And if we donï¿½ome countries
thrive despite the warming that is already under way, the world will lose
the fight against extreme poverty.

So it was great to hear President Biden and other leaders
repeatedly raising the importance of adaptation. I got to join the
president, along with officials from the United Arab Emirates, to launch
a program called Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s
designed to focus some of the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s innovative IQ on ways to help the
poorest people adapt, such as new varieties of crops that can withstand
more droughts and floods. More than 30 other countries, as well as dozens
of companies and nonprofits (including the Gates Foundation), are already
supporting it.

As part of that effort, I joined a coalition of donors that pledged more
than half a billion dollars to support the CGIARï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s work to advance
climate-smart innovations for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa
and South Asia.

Some people look at the problems that still need to be solved and see the
y. I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t share that view, but this is what I would
tell anyone who does: The glass is being filled up faster than ever. If
we keep this upï¿½ï¿½ï¿½if the world puts even more effort into innovations that
reduce the cost of getting to zero and help the poorest people adapt to
climate changeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½then weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll be able to look back on this summit as an
important milestone in avoiding a climate disaster.

                         Listen to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Word is Aliveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
As you listen to this song, think about the last time you opened YouVersion.
Maybe the first thing you noticed was how the Verse of the Day encouraged you.
Or perhaps you went to a Bible Plan and felt like it spoke directly to you. Or
maybe you typed something into Discover and found the exact Scripture you
needed.
Every time you open YouVersion, youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re allowing Godï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Word to speak to you and
shape you. And, with hundreds of millions of people, the global YouVersion
Community is proof that The Bible is Alive.
Together, as we listen to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Word is Alive,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worship God for who He is,
thank Him for what He has done, and prepare our hearts for what He is going to
do next. And as we proclaim the power of Godï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Word, letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s draw closer to Him
through this timeï¿½  liveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Even when the morning comes

It's Frank Andrade from Medium and YouTube.

Python offers a good number of libraries used in data science such as Pandas,
Numpy, and Scikit-learn. Learning those libraries right away and skipping the
basics isnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t good, though.

If you would like to learn Python for data science, you should master Python
core concepts first. Having a solid foundation in Python will help you avoid
common mistakes and bad practices. As a result, learning Python libraries used
in data science will be much easier.

  Hi Shawn,

  I hope everything is going well.

  I'm reaching out to you as I saw you did so much work on your resume, that I
  didn't want to see it expire because you left before checking out.
                                     
  But for a little less than a cup of coffee, and a little more than streaming

 Digital Transformation In Manufacturing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Key Learning Points From The
                           Automotive Industry

The manufacturing industry is positioned to take advantage of the
possibilities offered by artificial intelligence, automation, and
industry 4.0. To get an idea of the benefits and challenges that lie
ahead, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a good idea for manufacturers to look towards the automotive
manufacturers, which are perhaps further along the journey than other
manufacturers.

As a product, cars are evolving rapidly. Combustion engines are being
replaced by batteries, connected cars carry an ever-growing array of
hardware and software applications, and fully autonomous cars are not too
far down the road. In ordith the changes to their operations
and processes that this fast-paced evolution has made necessary, car
manufacturers have established themselves as pioneers when it comes to
tackling the challenges of digitization.

As well as adapting to new technological requirements, it has also been
necessary for automotive manufacturers to anticipate and align their
offerings with changing consumer behaviors. This includes demand for more
sustainable and less environmentally damaging products and new ways of
thinking about how we use cars, such as carpooling and ride-sharing.

 To get an idea of what the wider manufacturing industry can learn from
automotive manufacturers, I spoke to Aniello Pepe, Oracleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s global
director for automotive within its Industry Strategy Group.

Pepe tol""Automotive is an exciting place today ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ no other
manufacturing industry is going through such challenges ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the product is
completely changing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a product thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s becoming more digital, more
software, more electronics ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and that implies that the suppliers are
changing.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There are new suppliers, because they can provide new components ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
batteries, for example.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As well as this, customers are changing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ this is really affecting
everything, the way products are conceived, designed, tested, sold ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
there are new ownership trends and new financial models.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

The period we are going through right now is particularly critical, as
automotive manufacturers have to balance their need to innovate and look
towards the new era in electric, connected, and autonomous driving with
the fact that, for now, the majority of vehicles they sell and service
are still built around internal combustion engines. This will be equally
true f their customers will be ready to switch to using new, smart, and
automated versions of their products overnight.

The automotive industry is clearly anticipating and reacting to trends
that just about every other field of manufacturing will experience soon.
So, what are the lessons that can be learned?

Firstly, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s critical to understand the migration taking place towards
platforms. Manufacturers use software platforms in the design and
creation of new vehicles and to gather test data on how they will perform
in the real world (such as crash testing). Manufacturing is done through
platforms ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ connecting the IoT sensors and devices that make up a modern
assembly plant. Platforms exist for the vehicles themselves to enable
them to be connected and work together effectively as edge nodes for a
cloud platform. Platforms have been built out into sales and customer
service operations, allowing manufacturers to predict, based on data, the
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½next best actionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ in sales or service thaieve an
optimal outcome. And customers themselves interact with the vehicle
manufacturers via yet more platforms that allow information on their
experience to be collected and analyzed for insights into how things
could be done better or more efficiently.

Volkswagen Group, for example, has established its own software company,
CARIAD, which works on creating platform-based solutions for challenges
faced by manufacturers, as well as software solutions for customer
problems. This is in line with the wider trend of companies in many
industries reimagining themselves as tech companies in order to better
position themselves to use technology to solve problems. Currently, just
10% of the software platforms used by Volkswagen are created in-house. By
establishing Cariad, it hopes to increase this to 60% by 2025.

Likewise, Renault, in the words of its recently appointed CEO Luca De
Meo, intends to transform itself from a car company that works with
technology to a technology company that builds cars.

Business models are changing too. Renaultï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ambition is to generate 20%
of its revenue from services ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ sold through subscriptions ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ by 2030.

The second element that itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s critical to understand is the importance of
data. Digital services ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ based on collecting and analyzing data using
vehicles and sensors ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ are expected to generate one-third of the
automotive industry's revenue ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ around $1.5 trillion ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ by 2030. This will
require finding ways to extract insights from data that customers will be
w""bolted on"" to their car
purchases (or leases). Finding new ways to collect this data, mine it for
insights, and package it back to the consumer in return for subscription
fees will be a core driver of revenue for automotive manufacturers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and
eventually most other manufacturers too.

Pepe tells me that he sees three key challenges that automotive
manufacturers are tackling in order to make this vision a reality.
Firstly, they need to develop the capability to manage software at scale.
This includes dealing with the diverse range of markets and jurisdictions
that they operate in, which can involve a complex web of regulations and
legislation ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ particularly in relation to the use of data.

Secondly, it requires a new approach to product life cycles. Software and
electronics ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which make up 50% of the value of the typical car sold
today ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ require management and updates, and new functionality can be
added by creating new applications for existing hardware ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ such as the
range of senscars are equipped with. This
enables the creation of new services that can be paid for via
subscription (Teslaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Autopilot being perhaps the flagship example here).

Thirdly, thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s the ever-pressing issue of skills. Automotive
manufacturers are now less reliant on mechanical engineers and more
reliant on software engineers and data scientists. They need people who
are capable of setting up cloud platforms for gathering, storing, and
analyzing data ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the fuel of automation and industry 4.0 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ as well as
those capable of deploying cutting edge technologies such as AI ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ machine
learning, and neural networks. The scale of this transformation has been
immense in automotive manufacturing, and will be just as massive in other
manufacturing industries that are also preparing to make the leap.

All of this means that partnership choices are absolutely critical, and
Pepe tells me that this is where companies like Oracle, or indeed SaS, or
even Google ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ cloud hyperscalershey
have gone through many of the same processes themselves, building out
tech solutions with multiple novel customer touchpoints and a
service-focused delivery method.

He says, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Automotive manufacturers and their suppliers are still in the
middle of their transformation journey. Some are progressing faster;
others are plodding along with uncertainty. Winners will emerge quite
soon, and I think those will be the ones that are better able to
understand the implications of their transformation into software and
tech companies, and service and mobility providers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ they will be in a
better shape to survive an""For me, that means adopting cloud-based solutions and leveraging the
power of data through artificial intelligence.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

They are among the most popular assets for speculation and investment, yet have proven wildly volatile. Fast-fluctuating","Hi Shawn Ravi,

Over $40 billion worth of cryptocurrencies are traded every day. They are among
the most popular assets for speculation and investment, yet have proven wildly
volatile. Fast-fluctuating prices have made millionaires of a lucky few, and
delivered crushing losses to others. Could some of these price movements have
been predicted in advance?

In this competition, you will use your machine learning expertise to forecast
short term returns in 14 popular cryptocurrencies. We have amassed a dataset of
millions of rows of high-frequency market data dating back to 2018 which you can
use to build your model.
  Total Prizes:

                                    $125,000

  Entry Deadline:

                                January 25, 2022
                             Join This Competition
The simultaneous activity of thousands of traders ensures that most signals will
be transitory, persistent alpha will be exceptionally difficult to find, and the
danger of overfitting will be considerable. In addition, since 2018, interest in
the cryptomarket has exploded, so the volatility and correlation structure in
our data are likely to be highly non-stationary.

To be successful, you will need to pay careful attention to these
considerations, which will provide valuable insight into the art and science of
financial forecasting.

Good luck,

Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?
Do you know why Jesus said these words just before He diedï¿½ï""Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?"" that is, ""My God, My God, why have you forsaken
Me?"" - Matthew 27:46 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Up until that moment, Jesus had been beaten, mocked, and tortured by the people
who's sin He would ultimately take onto His shoulders.
Imagine knowing that you have to die for someone else, even for people that
hates you. Imagine you feel the crushing weight of God's wrath for all
humanity's sin on your shoulders, without having someone to bear it with you.
How would you feel? What thoughts would run through your mind?
A Man, without sin, takes unto Himself the sins of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ whole world. Jesus knew
exactly what needed to happen. He knew He had to die in order for us to live.
The weight of this immense task, laid heavily on His shoulders, but still He
endured and we must ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½THANK HIM EVERY DAY for doing t""After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the
Scripture), ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I thirst.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a
sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. When
Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It is finished,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and he bowed his
head"" - (ESV)
How amazing it must have been to witness what happens next, the sky is darkened,
the foundations of the temple are shaken and the curtain is torn in half. How
awesome the might and the power of God.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ John 11""Jesus said to her, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me,
though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in Me
shall never die. Do you believe this?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ - (ESV)
Ask yourself, do you believe thisï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
If you truly believe this, then make the decision today to live holy. Make every
day count, not wasting time on the things of this temporary world. We are SET
APART by God, renewed in our faith. Don't waste your life.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Do you really understand why Jesus said the following words,
Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?,
if you don't, then do not miss this week's fascinating video.
It is an extremely powerful video that will definitely surprise you,
highlighting the ultimate sacrifice Jesus made for us when He died on the cross.

           FATHER, TODAY I AM TRUSTING THAT I AM YOUR INSTRUMENT.

Whenever I feel lost or overwhelmed, I come back to this song. We are God's
handiwork. His instrument. And if we let Him, He will use us today.

Wood & Nails by The Porter's Gate (featuring Audrey Assad & Josh Garrels):

O humble carpenter, down on Your hands and knees
Look on Your handiwork and build a house
So You may dwell in me

The work was done with nothing but
Wood and nails in Your scar-borne hands

O show me how to work and praise
Trusting that I am Your instrument

O loving laborer with the sweat upon Your face
Oh, build a table that I may too may join You
In the Father's place

The work was done with nothing but
Wood and nails in Your scar-borne hands

O show me how to work and praise
Trusting that I am Your instrument

The kingdom's come and built upon
Wood and nails gripped with joyfulness

So send me out, within Your ways
Knowing that the task is finished

The dead will rise and give You praise
Wood and nails will not hold them down

These wooden tombs, we'll break them soon
And fashion them into flower beds

The curse is done, the battle won
Swords bent down into plowshares

Your scar-borne hands, we'll join with them
Serving at the table You've prepared

O humble carpenter.

Thank you, Lord.

Couple of days ago I wrote to you about the Halloween offer of 21% discount on
all Coding Ninjas courses when you'd use the Coupon code HALLOWEEN21. Not sure
if you saw the email.

Anyway, I wanted to let you know that there was a bug (read as: intern mistakeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½)
and the coupon code wasn't working at all. So sorry about that.

If you were looking to buy the course, you can still avail the 21% discount
using the Coupon code HALLOWEEN21. It expires tomorrow.

  Ninjas keep looking for reasons to celebrate, here's some festivities coming
  your way.
